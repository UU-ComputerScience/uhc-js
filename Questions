- How can I run (and create, for that matter) tests?
- Why do

%%][100
%%]]

blocks exist? Aren't they redundant?


- What comes first, fold.full.core or fold.core-1-initial?


- Constructors (e.g. cons and nil) have tags. Do they represent the ctr index?
    function cons(x,y) { return [0,x,y]; }
    var nil = [1];


- Does UHC support the OverloadedStrings extension?

type JSString = PackedString
stringToJSString :: String -> JSString
jsStringToString :: JSString -> String


- From blog post:

"There is choice whether to put document in the IO monad or not, depending
whether this global object itself will ever be assigned a new value or not. Not
being a Javascript DOM wizard wrapping in IO seems to be the safest bet."

If we had the guarantee that the document object cannot be reassigned, would we
still be confined to IO?

Some experimentation with the WebKit inspector suggests that document cannot be
reassigned. However, its child nodes can of course be manipulated.


- Are there known issues? Especially related to the JS shooting off into an
  endless loop?


- Is there a way to view the JS transformation passes as well? Or is that just
  one big pass?


- Where is the Haskell AST converted into the JS AST?
Part of this seems to be done in ToJScript.ag, but things like Expr_Str are not
part of the JS types... Ah, it is in fact done there, but the JS types are
being prefixed with J.Expr_. Is this some dark AG magic, or something that gets
preprocessed?
