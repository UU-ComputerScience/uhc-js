## What is UHC-JS?
UHC-JS is the JavaScript backend of the Utrecht Haskell Compiler. It is able of
compiling any Haskell program to JavaScript. This makes it possible to run your
Haskell programs in the browser. Furthermore there is now no more reason for
having to write the verbose language that is called JavaScript yourself. Hurray!

## Demo
The JCU app discussed in "Getting Rid of JavaScript with Haskell" has been put
online by [Chris Done](http://chrisdone.com/).

Go to the [instance](http://jcu.chrisdone.com/login). And log in with username
"uhcjsdemo@example.com" and password "123456". And check out the [source
code](https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/JCU). For installation instructions
please refer to the section "Locations and Setup" in "Getting Rid of JavaScript
with Haskell".

## Need help?
There are currently two major resources for help with UHC. The general [UHC
documentation][uhc-extensive-doc] describes the usage of UHC in general. The
[documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation.html) page provides documentation
for UHC JavaScript specific scenarios.

If you do not reach a solution, please don't hesitate to join the IRC channel
[#uhcjs](irc://irc.freenode.net/uhcjs) on FreeNode.



### Installation
For help installing see [Installation of UHC]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation.html#installation_of_uhc).

### GitHub and Issues
[Our repositories](https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/) are located at
GitHub. You will find the issue trackers there as well.

### Installation script for JCU-HS
An installation script for installing the JCU app together with its dependencies
is available from [this gist][jcu-install-script]. Currently the script does
**not** build nor install UHC for you.

If you trust us you may run the following command directly from your shell. It
will run the installer in your current working directory:

{% highlight ruby %}
ruby <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/gist/1902090/0588a1a1e5a7bb8935ee9afdd7d96949abbe7ff5/install.rb)
{% endhighlight %}

Follow the on screen instructions when running the installer.
