A short introduction: how to get started
----------------------------------------
Please report bugs in the UHC-JS backend or in the UHC-JS library in the [GitHub
Issue Tracker](https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc-js/issues). Please note
that UHC related issues will eventually get their own issue tracker once the UHC
has been moved to GitHub. Also consider joining
[#uhcjs](irc://irc.freenode.net/uhcjs) on FreeNode.
